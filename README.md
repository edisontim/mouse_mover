Move your mouse when needed

Sometimes I need to leave my computer for a bio-break and I do not want to have to log back in when my screen saver kicks in.

## 
1. Control the amount of time that this should run
2. How often to move the mouse

## Windows setup
Install python and pip required packages
* py -m pip --version
* py -m ensurepip --default-pip
* py -m pip install mouse
* py -m pip install pyautogui
